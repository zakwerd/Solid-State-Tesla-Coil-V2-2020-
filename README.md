# Solid State Tesla Coil V2.0 (2020)

## Overview 
This is my second attempt at building a solid-state Tesla Coil. My first attempt can be found [here](https://github.com/zakwerd/Musical-Solid-State-Tesla-Coil-2019-)

I will be updating this page as I go to keep you updated on my progress and to serve as a beneficial resource for myself. Unlike my repository outlining my first attempt, this repository will most likely not go into as much detail regarding how each component works, unless I find it beneficial to the structure of my build updates.

However, I hope this serves a comprehensive enough overview to give any non-engineers a general idea of how SSTCs function, while not being overly technical with explanations.
